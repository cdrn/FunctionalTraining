/**
 * Ok here are the rules.
 *
 * You can't use any of the standard list functions, like `map`, `filter`, `flatMap`, `append`, `:::`, `:+`, etc.
 *
 * But you can always use `Cons(head, tail)` to construct a new list by prepending an element to another list.
 *
 * You CAN and are encouraged to use the solutions from the exercises below to solve the harder
 * ones towards the end.
 *
 * Keep an eye out for repetition and similarities between your answers.
 *
 * REMEMBER: Follow the types, they almost always guide you to the solution.  If it compiles and looks a little
 * too simple, it's probably correct.  As Sherlock Holmes once said, "Each one is suggestive, together they are
 * most certainly conclusive."
 *
 * See if you can make your solution tail recursive, where possible.
