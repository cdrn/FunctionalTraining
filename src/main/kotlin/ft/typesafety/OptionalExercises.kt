/**
 * Use pattern matching and recursion.  No vars, no loops, no overriding.
 *
 * `Option` is an implementation of optional functionality.
 *
 * We've made these exercises to give you greater insight into how an optional pattern
 * might work in a functional language.
 *
 * When you see `Option` think: "It may exist, or it may not"
 *
 * There are two ways to construct an `Option`:
 *
 *   `Some()` represents something that exists
 *
 *   `None` represents something that doesn't exist
 *
 * We use `Option` in situations where there isn't certainty that a meaningful
 * value will be returned to us.
 *
 * For example, a Map in Kotlin is similar to many other languages,
 * we just need to tell it about the types we're working with.
 *
 *     This is the type of the key
 *                      |
 *                      |     This is the type of the value
 *                      |      |
 *                      |      |
 *     val myMap = mapOf<Int, String>( 1 to "one", 2 to "two", ...)
 *
 *   When we index a Map we will get back the nullable value type. Let's convert it to an `Option`:
 *
 *     Option.ofNullable(myMap[1]) = Some("one")  //The value exists and it's the string "one"
 *
 *     Option.ofNullable(myMap[0]) = None      //The value doesn't exist so we get None
 *
 *   `Some("one")` and `None` are both of the type Option
 *
 *   Since `Some` and `None` are the same type we can `when` match on them.
 *
 *   We can have one set of logic when we get Some back and a different set
 *   of logic when we get `None` back!
 *
 *   val mightBeSomething: Option<String> = Option.ofNullable(myMap[3])
 *
 *   when(mightBeSomething) {
 *     is Some -> "I got a String back!"
 *     else -> otherwise()
 *   }
 *
 * Good luck!
 *
